## Reified Property Graph Generation & Experimental Setup

### Prerequisites

- Ensure that you have correctly prepared the `datafile.bd` file as explained in the [`/Benchmark`](./Benchmark) folder.
- All scripts must be executed **in the same directory** where `datafile.bd` is located.

---

### Output

Running these scripts will generate a **Reified Property Graph (RPG)** â€” a property graph enriched with:

- Reified nodes  
- Reified edges  
- Nested abstraction levels  

---

### Preparation for experimental work

#### ðŸ”¹ For experience 4 â€” Reified Nodes & Edges
Run the following notebooks:
- `Add_reified_nodes.ipynb`
- `Add_reified_edges.ipynb`

These will add reified structures representing meaningful subgraphs.

#### ðŸ”¹ For experience 5 â€” Nested Abstraction Levels
Run:
- `Add_abstraction_levels.ipynb`

This script constructs multi-level abstraction by nesting reified elements inside one another.

Enjoy exploring high-level abstractions in your graph
