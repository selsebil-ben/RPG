Experiment 1:
Comparative and progressive execution (depending on dataset size) of simple queries without reification between:

a Cozo database

a Neo4J database

Both databases are represented using a simple property graph (PG).
Objective: To compare the performance of CozoDB and Neo4J as graph-oriented databases commonly used by the industrial and academic communities for property graph manipulation.



Experiment 2:
Comparative and progressive execution of simple queries without reification between:

a Cozo database represented as a simple property graph

a Cozo database represented as a reified property graph

Objective: To analyze the impact of the abstraction level (simple vs. reified graph) on the performance of simple queries.



Experiment 3:
Progressive execution of queries with reification on a Cozo database represented as a reified graph.
Objective: To study how the execution time of reification queries evolves with increasing dataset size.



Experiment 4:
Execution of queries with reification on a fixed-size Cozo database represented as a reified graph, varying the number of reified nodes and reified edges with two abstraction levels.
Objective: To observe the impact of the number of abstraction levels on the execution time of reification queries.



Experiment 5:
Execution of queries with reification on a fixed-size Cozo database represented as a reified graph, varying the number of abstraction levels.
Objective: To observe the impact of the number of abstraction levels on the execution time of reification queries.
